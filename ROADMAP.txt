- if the ancient dna motifs are observed at the end of the sequences, then cutting them short would render them modern?
- likewise, a smaller kernel migth impact the prediction power significantly?
- given that the architecture deepness is linked to the sequence length, consider using different lengths in training, or training different models
- potentially introduce regularization penalities
- once model works, test on denisovan & other species

simulation plan:
  - gargammel was cloned & patch for python version compatibility
  - gargammel only works on bash through conda enviroment
  - gargammel required to install several python packages, conda, and ms (samples under neutral models - rhudson, uchicago)
  - output writes to current directory, thus preferably run from gdata (gargammel data)
  - downloaded a reference human genome (h38) & softlink to gdata
  - manipulate gargammel params to create 100% bacterial contamination sample, where bacteria is in fact human sequences
  - declare softlinked human reference genome at gdata/bact/list
  - use gargammel params: composition = 0,0,1; mapdamage = missincorporation.txt (from gargammel Ust_Ishim)

TODO:
  - run deamination analysis on all simulated fasta sample pairs
  - clean & update code
  - add output paths performance & inference
  - document the project state
