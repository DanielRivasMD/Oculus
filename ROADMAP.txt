- if the ancient dna motifs are observed at the end of the sequences, then cutting them short would render them modern?
- likewise, a smaller kernel migth impact the prediction power significantly?
- given that the architecture deepness is linked to the sequence length, consider using different lengths in training, or training different models
- potentially introduce regularization penalities
- add validation set


- techical:
  - BUG: training accuracy
  - add verbose option on cnn training
  - add logging on cnn traing

  line 3      TODO   load both sequences, french & neandertal, and tag for training
